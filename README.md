### Podcastplayer

The app was developed in one week for the 10th UA devchallenge.it contest (year 2016). 
It fetches podcasts from feeds.rucast.net/radio-t and allows user to play them. There is also an ability to cache podcasts locally.

I do not support the repository, so used libraries may be out of date. I opensourced the app in hope that somebody may find the code useful.
